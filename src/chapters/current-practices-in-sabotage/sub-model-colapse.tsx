      <h3>Model collapse - self consumption </h3>
      <p>
        Model self consumption is affirmed to drastically decrease the quality
        of output. Thus a highly theoretical approach has been developed by
        saboteurs, proposing to further flood the internet with synthetic data,
        thereby accelerating this degradation process. The training data
        gathering process highly relies on online content. The consequences of
        an “autophagous loop” are explored in a 2023 research paper:
        “Self-Consuming Generative Models Go MAD”. “Some ramifications are
        clear: without enough fresh real data each generation, future generative
        models are doomed to Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), meaning that either
        their quality [...] or their diversity [...] will progressively degrade
        and generative artifacts will be amplified.” (Alemohammad et al., 2023).
        Further they warn that: “MAD could poison the data quality and diversity
        of the entire Internet.” (Alemohammad et al., 2023). In addition to that
        they inform practitioners only using synthetic data of the consequential
        dangers. Practitioners that want to solely use organic training data,
        but are unable to, since it is nearly impossible to identify synthetic
        data, can only be described as helpless. Efforts are made to watermark
        synthetic data, but this will always “introduce[] hidden artifacts”
        (Alemohammad et al., 2023).
        <Br /> Naturally the sabotage community follows this train of thought,
        implying to flood online content with synthetic media. Although there
        are technologies automating that, they have rarely been used for
        purposes of sabotage. Their use until now has mostly been focused on the
        accumulation of views on social media platforms. The Github repository

        promises income through automatic generation of short form videos on
        platforms like TikTok or Instagram.
        <Br />
        The use of such tools for the sabotage effort can only be seen as highly
        critical. This requires, in order to be effective, a multitude of
        participants, to reach a point of relative quantity compared to organic
        data, resulting in an internet increasingly saturated with low-value,
        generically engaging content. This would undermine the public online
        space in its authenticity and integrity.
