        The publication of Heidegger's “Black Notebooks” (Schwarze Hefte), which
        contain his personal writings from the 1930s to the 1970s, revealed
        instances of antisemitic sentiment. Moreover Heidegger sustained his
        membership in the Nazi Party from the early 1930s until its dissolution
        in 1945 (Farías et al., 1989). It is therefore necessary to view his
        philosophic statements with scrutiny. In the context of this research,
        Heidegger’s citations have been carefully examined.
