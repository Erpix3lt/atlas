        “Someone in Los Angeles had recently shot a computer with a gun [...]
        This was naive”(Larson, 2023). The most drastic of efforts against
        automation, at the time judged as “naive”, exemplifies the rich and
        often chaotic history of sabotage against computers. After the rapid
        adoption of computers in the U.S after World War II, more and more tasks
        were automated. Gradually, with assignment of higher significance to
        these high tech machines, computers came under attack. The Book
        "Computer Center Sabotage, 1968 - 1971", by Max Larson captures in great
        detail early, simple attacks onto computers, gradually proceeding to be
        more elaborate.

        Due to the high investments made into computer equipment at major
        Universities in the U.S, students deemed them as valuable. With the
        novelty of the computer, security measures were poor. Guided by
        different motives, students tried to support their efforts by
        vandalising, destroying and kidnapping computers from often unguarded
        technology centers in their campuses. By 1969 data processing magazine
        Business Automation declared: “The computer isn’t safe on campus
        anymore.” (Larson, 2023) Activists participating in such operations were
        labeled as naive. Administrators, computer experts and politicians
        judged their efforts as acts of technophobic rage, simple and unplanned.

        During the timespan of “1968 [ to ] 1971 there were at least twenty-­
        seven instances of computer center sabotage” (Larson, 2023) Partly
        destroying or kidnapping equipment in the range of up to 2 million
        dollars. Doing so the saboteurs were quite successful in their agenda.
        Their actions ranged from anti-war protests, gathering funds for
        judiciary support money for the black panther movement or simply
        antagonising an “overpowering, over-towering, impersonal, alien machine”
        (Larson, 2023). Reporting on the topic of computer centered sabotage it
        is important to link it to its earliest history.
