      <p>
        The word sabotage is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as following: “The
        malicious damaging or destruction of an employer's property by workmen
        during a strike or the like; hence gen. any disabling damage
        deliberately inflicted, esp. that carried out clandestinely in order to
        disrupt the economic or military resources of an enemy.” (Oxford English
        Dictionary, 2023) The motivations behind sabotage can be varied,
        including political, military, or personal reasons. It can be argued
        that sabotage is not limited to the efforts of a workmen against their
        employee’s property.

        Its etymology is an abbreviation from the french word sabot, describing
        a wooden shoe. As early as 1910s the word has been used to describe the
        tactic of french factory workers to throw wooden shoes into weaving
        machines effectively ruining them. This may be described as one of the
        earliest actions of sabotage against modern technology. The word
        technology stems from the Greek tekhnología, meaning systematic
        treatment of an art or craft. It combines téchnē (art, skill) and -logía
        (study). It shares a conceptual kinship with the latin word textere,
        meaning: woven from words or woven fabric. Philosophically the two have
        been linked, as weaving may be one of the oldest forms of technology

        , while the idea of interlacing elements is metaphorically similar to
        how technology combines materials and knowledge.

        The british luddite movement, though not to be used synonymously with
        the word sabotage, applied various techniques of → sabotage against
        owners of weaving factories, after they introduced automated machinery
        in 1811, thus resulting in job loss. Their efforts however were cut
        short by the brutal knockdown of soldiers deployed by the government.

        Popular figures such as Lord Byron sympathised for the luddites, leading
        him to write the poem: Song For The Luddites,

      <p className="citation ml-2 mt-1">
        “[...] we Will die fighting, or live free, And down with all kings but
        King Ludd! [...]" (Byron, 1816).

        A recent article in The New Yorker draws a connection between early
        sabotage movements and today’s push back to job displacement caused by
        AI. It references Brian Merchant’s book "Blood in the Machine",
        highlighting its argument that “although the forces of mechanization can
        feel beyond our control, the way society responds to such → changes is
        not” (Chayka, 2023).

        “If I say technology, you should think of power. If I say capitalism,
        you might think of profit” (Sadowski, 2025) appears as one of the
        shortest summaries of the techno-centered society we find ourselves in
        currently. A monopolisation of technology, pushes the agenda of a
        handfull companies into our daily lives. Jathan Sadowski even goes as
        far as framing those structures as the foundation of society.
        Additionally our reality is shaped by laws we are governed by, yet
        technology does rarely face the same boundaries of states. EU privacy
        law surely regulates and protects our data, while it cannot effectively
        prevent the negative consequences of certain applications.

        This is amplified by the tight knit structures and lobbying work that is
        put into government bodies. The power to own economic capital,
        guarantees the choice of where to invest it. Investing money into
        research & development thus always is connected to one’s trajectory of
        motives. It is up to the investor to make the choice between projects.
        This being said, it seems, that individual agency towards technology
        seems to be limited. With the recent surge of Artificial Intelligence,
        often programs that require an abundance of funding and computing power,
        one’s agency shrinks even further.

          This leads to the question, whether sabotage against AI gives back
          such rare agency to individuals or small interest driven groups?

        This research will utilize a combination of methods in order to resolve
        this question. It is important to mention that this research tries to
        view AI as a whole. Only the discourse around sabotage methods and the
        final product proposal will focus on current AI technologies. This is to
        avoid irrelevance if current technology is replaced by future
        developments. A literature review will be conducted. Historically
        significant sabotage projects are to be compared to contemporary
        research and occurrences of sabotage against AI. Equal themes and
        motives will be gathered. This will be combined by a theoretical
        research of the concept of sabotage. Again will similar philosophies be
        collected. As this research aims to highlight current processes,
        interviews with researchers and saboteurs will be conducted. Finally the
        proposal of a critical design object will be presented.
