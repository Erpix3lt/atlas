      <h2>Ethical implications of AI</h2>
      <p>
        “Likewise, the essence of technology is by no means anything
        technological. Thus we shall never experience our relationship to the
        essence of technology so long as we merely represent and pursue the
        technological, put up with it, or evade it. [...] but we are delivered
        over to it in the worst possible way when we regard it as something
        neutral; “ (Heidegger, 1954)
        <Br />
        As early as 1954 Heidegger argued that technology in its essence cannot
        be neutral. It is therefore a highly interesting question to ask, if
        sabotage against technology, in this case primarily AI, is ethically
        positive?
        <Br />
        Generally speaking one must always use a utilitarian approach, when
        reasoning positively for the use of sabotage, regardless of the context.
        A greater good can only then be justified by the immorality of certain
        actions. Looking at sabotage from a deontologist standpoint, it cannot
        be judged positively as the actions required often include immoral
        practices, violating, as a consequence, the rules of human dignity.
        <Br />
        Focussing on a utilitarian standpoint, it is important that negative
        implications by the further development of AI are perceived as real and
        substantial. Such implications might harm minority groups, give
        exceeding power to a selected group of people or simply diminish the
        greater good in any form. It shall now not be the case to argue for such
        implications, but rather perceive them as given, in order to proceed the
        argumentation. Recent efforts in ecological sabotage have been far more
        public than those of sabotage against AI, therefore work based on
        ecological sabotage will be used in order to argue metaphorically for
        and against technological sabotage.
        <Br />
        One of the most controversial works in this domain is Andreas Malm’s
        book "How to Blow Up a Pipeline", in which he calls for direct action in
        the climate movement. Malm distinguishes between violence against
        property and violence against persons, arguing that the former is at a
        time of systemic crisis necessary. He states: “There has been a time for
        a Gandhian climate movement; perhaps there might come a time for a
        Fanonian one. The breaking of fences may one day be seen as a very minor
        misdemeanour indeed.” (Malm, 2021)
        <Br />
        The philosopher Ivan Illich (1973), proposes in his work "Tools for
        Conviviality" a separation of technological tools into two categories:
        The first being <HighlightedBlack>convivial</HighlightedBlack>. These
        are tools that enhance one’s freedom, opportunity and creativity. They
        do allow autonomous and cooperative use: “Convivial tools rule out
        certain levels of power, compulsion, and programming [...]” (Illich,
        1973) The second, being{" "}
        <HighlightedBlack>manipulative</HighlightedBlack> tools, essentially
        controlling and restricting one’s action. They divert agency and result
        in more dependence. Thereby he effectively warns of a reduction of
        individual autonomy under the disguise of progress. While he does not
        call for sabotage of such tools directly, he urges for a
        reconsideration.
        <Br />
        Aggressive, violent forms of sabotage have often been critiqued,
        alongside their obvious moral implications, as having negative effects
        on the cause itself. Moderates promoting the cause, might thereby be
        negatively associated with those conducting violent acts. Analysing this
        entanglement Herbert H. Haines authored in 1980 one of the most well
        known studies of the so-called “radical flank effects”. "The paper
        examined the interactive processes between moderate and radical factions
        within social movements, where the actions of the radical flank were
        either beneficial or detrimental to the reputation and effectiveness of
        the moderate faction. Haines found that militant Black activism in the
        US Civil Rights Movement led to funding increases for moderate
        mainstream civil rights groups and helped with the movement’s overall
        legislative success.” (Kristensen, 2023) However it is not clear whether
        this dynamic exists in every context where it is being applied, as “It
        should be noted that a holistic view of the academic literature
        available paints a more unclear picture of the effectiveness of radical
        flanks, with some studies seemingly finding no significant results
        regarding their impact – and some coefficients even pointing towards
        their negative effects.” (Kristensen, 2023)
        <Br />
        Circling back to Heidegger, he does not argue against violent acts of
        sabotage, rather he calls for the importance of{" "}
        <HighlightedBlack>
          technological critique by means of non technology
        </HighlightedBlack>
        , thereby critiques conducted through art. “Because the essence of
        technology is nothing technological, essential reflection upon
        technology and decisive confrontation with it must happen in a realm
        that is, on the one hand, akin to the essence of technology and, on the
        other, fundamentally different from it. Such a realm is art.”
        (Heidegger, 1954)
