      <h2>Does the saboteur regain agency?</h2>
      <p>
        With the theoretical, historical, and contemporary examples discussed,
        this section explores whether the saboteur can truly regain agency. The
        saboteur, per definition, always inserts themselves as an agent of
        disruption into a structure of monopolistic power. In the domain of
        Artificial Intelligence, this framework is safeguarded by a few heavily
        funded players, such as Open AI, while only a substructure can be
        attributed to open source projects. In this case sabotage is conducted
        against systems that seem autonomous, overpowering or out of reach.
        Circling back to Heidegger, this is what he may describe as the
        “enframing” through technology. Whether these efforts can be effective
        is another question. Still, they can certainly be seen as a refusal to
        be rendered passive. For that reason agency is always expressed, but is
        it ever truly regained? One might argue that the saboteur acts within
        the system itself in order to corrupt it. The case might be made that
        the saboteur thereby only reacts, while they do not “reframe” the system
        itself.
        <Br />
        The earlier mentioned report “Optimizing the crisis” serves as a fitting
        example. The report argues that “[the] nature of optimization systems
        can be exploited” (Phenomenal World, 2019). They utilise technology
        against itself. This has been documented as greatly effective. For that
        matter, they were able to use allowed user input as a wedge to:
        “strategically take out and repay loans in such a way that the retrained
        model would be debiased” (Phenomenal World, 2019).
        <Br />
        Still encased in the system itself, sabotage might be effective, but it
        does respond to technology on its own terms. Thereby it risks affirming
        the issue it tries to critique.

        Agency is always expressed, but is it ever truly regained?

        <Br />
        Hence Heidegger’s suggestion of utilising art against technology. This
        is a true counter to the system, one that is able to “reframe”. Within
        this contextual basis sabotage can be seen as a double edged act. For
        one it is truly capable of expressing agency and means of resistance,
        all while its effect heavily relies on the effort and the context. On
        the other hand the saboteur may inadvertently take agency from those
        that lack the technical understanding and tools needed. As an effect
        sabotage can become an elite practice, one that unintentionally reflects
        the power structures of the very system it tries to push against. In
        this case it is important to democratise these efforts, in order not to
        conduct sabotage at the cost of a less broader resistance.
        <Br />
        Thus the act of sabotage might not so much be the act itself, rather the
        point that it has been executed. It might not be the disruption of a
        system through a hack itself, but rather the conversation it gets going.
        It is the ability to “reframe” an otherwise safeguarded system through
        opening a discussion. This pushes momentum towards a movement, which
        does not only intrigue those linked to it but also a wider audience. It
        is worth conducting sabotage, if the motives are ethical and the effort
        does not simply target its opponent but rather also aims at kicking off
        broader effects.
        <Br />
        One is able to notice, when observing the sabotage effort against AI,
        that saboteurs often carefully document their practices. The Algorithmic
        Sabotage Research Group (ASRG) do even offer workshops and instructions,
        all to increase the movement's popularity. Social media platforms like
        Reddit or Mastodon serve as a room for discussion, not only about the
        technicalities but also about motives. This fosters a sense of
        togetherness against a seemingly unreachable goal. Momentum thereby is
        achieved.
